# BinarySearchTree
Created a binary search tree data structure with C++ using a node class. Developed functionalities for adding/searching nodes, and traversing the tree in order or as an ASCII art tree.


# Binary Search Tree Project

## Description
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The program allows for the insertion, searching, and deletion of nodes in a binary search tree structure.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `g++` installed to compile C++ code.
- Git was installed to clone the repository.

### Steps to run the program:
1. Move to the directory where you want to clone the project:
   ```bash
   cd <your-directory>
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjung9648/BinarySearchTree
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BinarySearchTree/
   
4. Compile the main.cpp file using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp
   
5. (Optional) Set execute permissions for the compiled output (if needed):
   ```bash
   chmod 777 main.cpp
   
6. Run the compiled program. Test code with .txt files("areacode.txt", "pokemon.txt", "california.txt", "stooges.txt", "halloween calories 2.txt", "years.txt", "halloween calories.txt"):
   ```bash
   ./a.out

7. Check 7 "n'th_testfile.txt" in BinarySearchTree directory.
